All of the files listed above are needed for
the simulations. LaBr3_v3.cc is provided in case it's needed. 
There are 5 modes:
1 - Single Cylindrical GRIFFIN LaBr3:Ce Detector
2 - Single Hexagonal BGO Detector
3 - Cylindrical DRAGON Array
4 - Hexagonal DRAGON Array
5 - Timing Method Array
The simulation uses LaBr3 doped with a 5% mole fraction of Ce.
5 GRIFFIN detectors follow the timing method arrangement in mode 5.

The macros are used to simulate sources to generate spectra. 
They show how the simulations are run. The internal radiation
of 138La can be simulated but it's not required since the experimental
spectra can have this internal radiation removed. 

The files labelled "(Thesis)" are the files that exactly produce
the results in the thesis. The other files have small improvements
in the code, which affect the way the detector efficiency results are randomly produced.
DetectorConstruction (Numbered Positions).cc is the improved version of DetectorConstruction (Thesis).cc. 
The most significant improvement is the energy resolution function in SteppingAction.cc, which
is able to use all of the events in a spectrum to form a peak. However, it can't
exactly model the energy resolution as given in the code. 

The placement of neighbouring detectors can also affect the detector efficiency results.
For instance, a source placed 5 cm away from the same detector yields a spectrum
with more gamma ray counts for mode 5, where this detector is in the middle of a group
of 5 detectors, compared to mode 1 where this detector is alone. 

DetectorConstruction (Algorithm).cc is able to simulate the DRAGON array
for any cylindrical or hexagonal size where the air gap between the detectors
can also be adjusted. This algorithm is also applied on the timing method array,
where two algorithms are suggested; one where the detectors are sitting on top of the gas target box,
and one where the detectors are touching the side of the gas target box. 
This algorithm's detector positions are slightly different from the actual
DRAGON array detector positions and the actual timing method array detector positions.
The numbered positions are included as comments in this file. 
The photomultiplier tube diameter can be adjusted to automatically
scale the other array detector dimensions. For the GRIFFIN detector,
the aluminium case diameter is adjusted to scale its other dimensions. 
DetectorMessenger (Algorithm).cc allows the air gap to be interactively adjusted
in LaBr3_v3. 

However, adjusting the photomultiplier tube diameter or
the aluminium case diameter in LaBr3_v3 changes that dimension alone. 
The code needs to be changed and recompiled to completely
scale the detector size. The .hh files are common to all of the different files. 
The macro files need to be manually adjusted if the code is changed for
the internal radiation sources to match the size and shape of the scintillator crystals. 

The labels in the brackets such as (Algorithm) need to be removed so the files can be used to compile the code.
In the Geant4 virtual machine, the files would be simply named DetectorConstruction.cc, DetectorMessenger.cc, etc. 

You can use the code for your research, but check with your supervisor
or with a Geant4 expert before publishing anything. The code may
need to be modified for your purposes. Please cite me to provide credit.

There will be no further changes to the code on my end. Any other updates
are minor to improve the existing content. 

Thank you for reading.
